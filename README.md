# Simple Web Application

This is a simple web application built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture. The application leverages several design patterns and principles to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Focuses on the core domain and its logic, allowing for a more intuitive and flexible design.
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Separates the application's core logic from external concerns, such as user interfaces and databases, promoting testability and adaptability.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separates read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Enhances the functionality of existing classes without modifying their structure, promoting code reuse.
- **Repository Pattern**: Provides a centralized way to manage data access, abstracting the underlying data storage mechanism.
- **Action Domain Responder**: Replaces the traditional MVC pattern, allowing for a more straightforward handling of user actions and responses.
